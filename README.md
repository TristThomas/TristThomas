- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Tristan Thomas - a current 2nd year Business Analytics student at the University of Southampton (currently in search of a placement opportunity for 3rd year)

- ðŸ‘€ During my second year at university I have become increasingly intrigued by 'Data Analytics', and specifically SQL, R and Tableau 
      --> thanks to SAS, VBA and business forecasting (using R) modules 

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning SQL in my spare time, outside of my studies, so I have decided to document my progress here through projects!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me --> feel free to send an email to 'tristthomas10@gmail.com'
